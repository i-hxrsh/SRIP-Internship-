# SRIP-Internship-
This repository is related to my work in Summer Research Internship Program (IIT Gandhinagar) from May 2022 to July 2022.
I worked on a self learning robot, Model Based Iterative Learning Controller and a Reinforcement Learning based controller. 
Matlab Codes have all the graphs and codes I worked on related to different parameters of the MBIL controller. 
The final report is also attacehd for complete understanding of the project.
